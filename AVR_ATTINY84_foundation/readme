# ATTINY84 library

##Description
This is a library of basic functions that will serve as the foundation for a wireless data link between 2 or more 
microcontrollers. The ATTINY84 lacks a true hardware SPI interface, so this library implements 3 wire SPI through the
ATTINY84 USI interface. The wireless device is a Nordic Semiconductor NRFL01+

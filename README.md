# AVR_ATTINY84_prototype
ATTINY84 Universal Serial Interface driver

This is a small proof of concept to handle SPI communication between two ATTINY84 chips using their USI interface to achieve   three wire SPI mode.

This will serve the foundation for a library to interface with RF wireless units.
